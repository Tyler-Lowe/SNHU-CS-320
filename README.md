CS 320 - Software Testing and Quality Assurance Portfolio
Project Artifacts
This repository contains the following files that demonstrate my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance:

Contact.java: The Contact class that represents a contact object with attributes like ID, name, phone number, and address.
ContactService.java: The service class that manages contact objects, including adding, updating, and deleting them.
ContactTest.java: Unit tests for the Contact class, testing the creation and validation of contact attributes.
ContactServiceTest.java: Unit tests for the ContactService class, ensuring correct functionality for adding, updating, and deleting contacts.
Summary and Reflections Report (from Project Two): A written reflection on my unit testing approach and overall software testing techniques used in the course.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional, I write unit tests for each important part of the program to make sure it works as expected. Running these tests after every change helps catch bugs early. I also use input validation to make sure that the data being used in the program is correct and won’t break the code. Security is ensured by limiting access to sensitive parts of the code and preventing things like invalid data from being stored. Regularly testing for both functionality and security vulnerabilities is key.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs, I look at the project requirements and think about what the user is trying to accomplish with the software. I try to make sure that the program is simple and easy to use while still fulfilling all of the necessary features. Sometimes, it helps to get feedback from actual users or the client to make adjustments. Throughout the project, I keep revisiting the requirements to make sure I’m building something that actually solves the user’s problems.

How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I start by thinking about what the software needs to do and how users will interact with it. I plan out the main features and break them into smaller tasks. I also make sure to design the software in a way that it’s easy to update or change in the future. I think about the structure of the code, like where the data is stored and how different parts of the program will talk to each other. Testing is built into the design from the start to make sure everything works right as I build.

Feel free to edit the README further to better reflect your own experience, but this should cover all the main points! Let me know if you need anything else.
